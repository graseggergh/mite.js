* PROBLEM

  Firefox returns status code 0, if there is an error, instead of 401, 404, 500 etc. 
  It also does not return the response text, which could be used as a fallback when status code is 0.

  CURRENT SOLUTION

  Any other code than 2XX are treated as error, without differentiation.

  TODO

  Try to find out the reason behind Firefox returning status code 0 and a smarter solution then
  the current one for a better error handling.
