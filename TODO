* PROBLEM

  Firefox returns status code 0, if there is an error, instead of 401, 404, 500 etc. 
  It also does not return the response text, which could be used as a fallback when status code is 0.

  CURRENT SOLUTION

  corsapi.mite.yo.lk does return a status code 200 if there has been an error and puts the status
  code in the response body. mite.query checks the response body for possible issues.

  TODO

  Try to find out the reason behind Firefox returning status code 0 and a smarter solution then
  the current one.
